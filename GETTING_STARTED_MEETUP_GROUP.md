# Create a new Meetup Group

Kubernetes and Cloud Native Indonesia is an organisation for cloud native (CNCF) Meetup Groups in Indonesia to collaborate.
Participating Meetup Groups can apply for CNCF membership and become official Cloud Native Computing Foundation Meetup Groups.
The details for applying can be found at [https://github.com/cncf/meetups#how-to-apply](https://github.com/cncf/meetups#how-to-apply)
once the group is created and has proven to be an active group. The catch is you need to maintain payment subscription through credit card
for the meetup group until you have done 3 meetups. If you want to avoid this, reach out to CNCF Ambassador **@girikuncoro** on 
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/girikuncoro) or [Telegram](https://t.me/girikuncoro) to let him create one for you for **free**.

Below you can find a “how to” guide for getting started with the creation of a kubernetes and cloud native meetup group.
Please let [@girikuncoro](https://twitter.com/girikuncoro) know your interest, so that he can invite you to private meetup organizers group.

## Prepare the Meetup Group creation

The premise is that you want to create a Meetup Group in a city in Indonesia, where no meetups connected to Cloud Native Indonesia
already exist. The easiest way to see what meetups already exist under the Cloud Native Indonesia brand, is probably to look at the
[list](https://github.com/cloudnative-id/meetups/blob/master/README.md).

If you do not find your city in the list please suggest the creation of a new meetup in your city in our Telegram group (mention @girikuncoro or @imrenagi)
and there will be response to that suggestion and help you getting started.

Once the decision for the creation of the meetup group has been decided, there are a couple of things that needs to be addressed.

## Create the Meetup on Meetup.com

*(You can skip this step by asking @girikuncoro to create one for you, but feel free if you want to do it yourself)*

Go to [https://meetup.com](https://meetup.com) and create an account there. Once you have that you can continue with the remaining tasks.

* Create the meetup group on meetup.com
* The naming used is Kubernetes-Cloud-Native-`City`, because people know about Kubernetes, but not Cloud Native yet. Jakarta is exception because we started first.
* Find some local people that will help you with the creation of the meetup.com group
* Follow the guides for creating a new [meetup group](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002882111-Starting-a-Meetup-group).
* Follow the guide for creating the [first event](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002881251).
* (WIP) Remember to use the artwork for the Meetup group and the event.
